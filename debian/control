Package: glslc
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Built-Using: ${built-using}
Description: Command line compiler for GLSL/HLSL to SPIR-V
 glslc wraps around core functionality in glslang and SPIRV-Tools. glslc and
 its library aims to provide:
    - a command line compiler with GCC- and Clang-like usage, for better
    integration with build systems;
    - an API where functionality can be added without breaking existing clients;
    - an API supporting standard concurrency patterns across multiple operating
    systems;
    - increased functionality such as file #include support.
 .
 This package contains the glslc binary.
